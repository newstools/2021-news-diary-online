First published by Longmans, Green Co in 1967, “The Sokoto Caliphate” is the product of a groundbreaking research by Professor Denis Murray Last when he was a PhD student at the University of Ibadan.  The book’s subject is the 19th century Sokoto Caliphate, the state that evolved out of the jihad led by Uthman dan Fodio. At the height of its growth, it stretched east-west from present-day Cameroon to Burkina Faso, and north-south, from Agadez to Ilorin.  European colonialists, especially British and French administrators, referred to the state back then as the Fulani Empire.
