The House of Representatives has urged Service Chiefs to work towards ending attacks and kidnapping on highways by suspended bandits in the country. The resolution was sequel to a unanimous adoption of a motion by Rep. Abubakar Nalaraba (APC-Nasarawa) at plenary on Wednesday.  Moving the motion, Nalaraba said that there was need to curtail the upsurge in attacks on highways in the country, particularly the Kaduna-Abuja highway. He said that on Nov. 21, at about 2 p.m. there was an attack on the highway and many travelers were believed to have been kidnapped, adding that a former governorship aspirant also lost his life in the process.  “These bandits have continued to block roads to enable them carry out their attacks and these attacks have caused a lot of panic in the hearts of Nigerians plying the highway.  “That we resolved to urge the Inspector General of Police, the Chief of Army Staff and heads of other security agencies to stop this daily attacks by bandits on our highways,’’ he said. Rep. Nicholas Ossai (PDP-Delta) said that lots of money was appropriated for defence and security in 2020 budget, with little or no result. Ossai recommended that the House Committees on Police, Army, Navy, Air Force, Defence and other security agencies be briefing the house on monthly basis on security issues.  The house resolved that the joint committee on security should brief the principal officers monthly and the general house quarterly on the security situation in the country and progress made so far in curbing the menace. In his ruling, the Deputy Speaker, Rep. Ahmed Wase mandated all relevant committees to ensure compliance. (NAN)
