Chief Victor Umeh, former National Chairman, All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), has commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) over the introduction of Bimodal Verification Accreditation System (BVAS). Umeh, who is the agent of Prof. Charles Soludo, the gubernatorial candidate of APGA in Saturday’s election, said the usage of the device made the process seamless.  He made the commendation in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Sunday in Awka. Umeh said though the BVAS has its challenge, the device was good when compared to the card reader machine.  “Yesterday, the BVAS device could not capture the finger prints of older people and that reduced the number of people who apparently would have voted,” he said. Umeh said that APGA was grateful to INEC and security operatives for the provision of conducive environment for the exercise. “We are grateful to God that the election was largely peaceful except for Ihiala where the Commission was unable to distribute the election materials due to some hiccups,” he said.  Umeh said that he was at INEC state headquarters for the collation of election results, adding that the party was thankful to Anambra people for believing in her. (NAN)
