The NNPC on Tuesday disowned a fake quiz competition trending online which claims to celebrate its 50th anniversary.  This was disclosed in a statement by Garba Deen Muhammad, Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, NNPC on Tuesday.  Muhammad said in the purported quiz contest, unsuspecting participants are encouraged to answer four questions on their knowledge of the Corporation, with the eventual winner standing the chance of winning some cash reward of up to N30,000.  “The NNPC wishes to state categorically that it has nothing to do with the purported 50th anniversary quiz contest”, the spokesman said.
