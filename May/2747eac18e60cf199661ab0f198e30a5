The clash also resulted in some casualties on the ISWAP side.   When contacted by PRNigeria, the spokesersons of the military and intelligence services were reluctant to talk. Some of the spokespersons are currently attending a capacity building workshop at the Nigerian Army Resources Centre Abuja.  By PRNigeria
