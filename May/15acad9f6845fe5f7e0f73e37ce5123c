He also thanked the U.S. president for Washington’s “unconditional support” when it comes to Israel’s right to self-defence. The conversation between Netanyahu and Biden was the second official one since the beginning of the conflict.   Meanwhile, Biden has briefed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Washington’s diplomatic engagement in the ongoing conflict, the White House said in a statement.
