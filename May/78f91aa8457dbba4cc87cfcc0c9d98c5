The Ekiti Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Olawale Fapohunda said the inmates who were granted clemency by the governor were serving various terms for offences such as stealing and housebreaking.   He said the inmates were considered for clemency after recommendations by the Ekiti Committee on Prerogative of Mercy. “The beneficiaries are considered based on account of good conduct, remorsefulness and period left to serve at the centre,” the attorney-general, who was represented by the Director of Public Prosecution,  Julius Ajibare, said.   He further advised them to be of good conduct as they rejoined society,  avoid conducts inimical to the peace of the society and shun vengeance. He also urged them to avoid anything that could bring them back to the centre.   The beneficiaries were: Akinyemi Faith, Romiluyi Femi, Adebusuyi Deji, Philip Michael, Isa Kadere, Dayo Julius and Abiodun Oluwatosin.
