The “General public (is) hereby asked to disregard the media report as fabrications of anti-constitutional democratic stability in Nigeria.(sic)  According to the statement, “Malami remains a true democrat who believes in the rule of law and tenets of democracy and Constitutional order.  “The Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice is a constitutionally recognised one with its role and responsibilities embedded in the constitution.  “It is antithetical to common sense to think that the holder of such coveted Office as the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice will stoop to what was printed by the media.  “The Government does not operate in secrecy as it is not a clandestine operation. Hence, Malami discharges his constitutionally recognized mandates in compliance with principles of transparency, openness and accountability.”
