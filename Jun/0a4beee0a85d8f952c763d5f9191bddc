The video was shared on various social media platforms claiming that it was supplying arms to insurgents in the area. While Speaking to PRNigeria, Naval Spokesperson, Commodore Suleman Dahun confirmed that there is a military training area in Magbon, Badagry. “If we want to go for training we take permission from Lagos control tower and fly there, land, and do other maneuvers and come back.
