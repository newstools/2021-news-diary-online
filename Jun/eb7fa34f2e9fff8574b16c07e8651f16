Their respective letters read by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan at plenary Wednesday laid claim to that.  Senator Yau, in his letter said his decision was “necessitates by the endemic crisis that engulfed the Zamfara state chapter of the PDP, which led the national body to dissolve the state EXCO of the party”.  He said this has negatively affected effective representation of his people, adding that he has widely consulted with his people and decided to defect from “the crisis-ridden party to a more formidable and peaceful party, the APC”.  Sahabi Yau is the Senate Deputy Minority Whip, but with this decision he will have to relinquish the position, which belongs to the minority party.
