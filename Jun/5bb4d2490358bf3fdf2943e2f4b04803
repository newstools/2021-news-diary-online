A former governor of Anambra,  Dr Chukwuemeka Ezeife has reiterated support for Sen. Uche Ekwunife, governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. Ezeife, the first civilian governor of Anambra, also denied endorsing any other aspirant. He made this known in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in Enugu.   The elder statesman said he could only pray for any aspirant  who visited  him and that was what he did for those who sought his support. “My endorsement of any one aspiring for Anambra governorship today, must follow a certain pattern. “I have never visited anywhere with any other person than Ekwunife and I have given my words on her to her party, PDP.   “She is my beloved daughter in whom I am well pleased and I know that she  has worked very well for the people of Anambra, especially those she represents at the senate. “She has proven that if given the state to rule, she will do very well. She remains the only candidate I have endorsed. “If people misunderstood visit of any other aspirant to my place, I will refer them to my statement when I escorted  Ekwunife to PDP and my address to the good people of Anambra South the day she interacted with them,” Ezeife said.   Ezeife maintained that with the overwhelming accomplishments by Ekwunife so far, she could govern Anambra creditably if given the opportunity. He enjoined the people of Anambra to be steadfast with her and support her dream. “I have prophesied to her years back, that she will be the first woman to be elected as governor in Nigeria because of her dutifulness and commitment to the people and her numerous accomplishments,” Ezeife added.   NAN reports that Ekwunife  and others will be contesting for the PDP guber primaries. (NAN)
