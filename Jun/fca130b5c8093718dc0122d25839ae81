Mbah said that the TS includes Kumbotso, Dan Agundi, Dakata, Tamburawa,  Kwanar Dangora, Wudil and Kankia. Others, according to her, are Katsina, Daura, Dutse, Hadejia, Azare and Gagarawa . She said that the new Kano region currently has ongoing transmission substation projects which when completed would further increase bulk transmission capacity in the new region.   Mbah said that the  transmission region would  further improve operational efficiency within the region and enable TCN engineers to readily access and resolve technical issues within the new region. ” Before the creation of the  region, major decisions has to be referred to Kaduna region for directives, and supply of materials were sometimes delayed due to logistic from Kaduna,   “The proximity of the new region would radically reduce downtime and eliminate time lost when materials have to be conveyed from the Kaduna region,” she said.
