Lawan added:”Our security agencies particularly our intelligence agencies must continue to fish out such issues even before they happen. “This is the essence of the intelligence that is supposed to be given to those who are in the system, to nip in the bud, where necessary or when such incidence happen that we are able to apprehend the people involved.”  A minute silence was also observed in honour of the deceased.Lawan, thereafter, prayed for the soul of Gulak and also condoled with his family, his state and the government and people of Nigeria.The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Gulak was shot dead by gunmen in Owerri, Imo on May 30 while on a national assignment.(NAN)
