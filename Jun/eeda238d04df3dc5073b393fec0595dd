The Elites Network for Sustainable Development (ENetSuD), an anti-corruption Civil Society Organisation, has confirmed that all the nine (9) Bills passed by the Kwara House of Assembly (KWHA) in the second legislative year were presented by Gov. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq. This was disclosed by the Coordinator of ENetSuD, Dr Abdullateef Alagbonsi, while releasing part of the reports of #KwaraBillsTracker, an initiative of ENetSuD that monitors legislative activities in the area of lawmaking, motions and matters of public importance considered by the house.   ENetSuD is a CSO promoting good governance, transparency and accountability. Alagbonsi stated that none of the nine bills was initiated or sponsored by any of the lawmakers.
