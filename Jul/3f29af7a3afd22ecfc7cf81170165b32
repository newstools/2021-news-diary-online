The Kano State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) said on Friday that flood killed 26 people and destroyed over 1,000 houses in four Local Government Areas of the state from April to date.  The Executive Secretary, Kano SEMA, Dr Saleh Jili, confirmed the figures in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kano. Jili said that 50 other persons sustained injuries due to the the flood and windstorm. According to him, the affected local government areas are Bunkure, Minjibir, Tarauni and Doguwa.  He said that the Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NiMet) had earlier predicted that there would be flooding in 25 local government areas of the state this year. The SEMA boss said the agency had visited the affected areas to sympathise with the victims on behalf of state government and distributed relief materials to them to alleviate their suffering. “The items distributed included bags of cement, bags of rice, maize, millet, roofing sheets and toiletries,’’ he said. The executive secretary, however, commended Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje and the state Commissioner for Special Duties, Mr Muntari Ishaq, for supporting the agency. He called on donor agencies and wealthy individuals to assist in supporting the victims. “Our economy is down due to COVID-19; the government cannot do it alone,’’ he said.  Jili also called on those living close to rivers and ponds in the state to vacate the areas for one to two months period. “If the rivers and ponds are over filled with water, please vacate your houses,’’ the SEMA boss advised.  He further urged residents of the state to clear the drains in front of their houses to prevent flooding.  “I urge those who are not yet affected by the flood to do everything possible to prevent it by clearing their drainages, collecing refuge and taking it to the appropriate place,’’ he said.  Jili added that the agency would not relent in its effort to ensure protection of lives and properties. (NAN)
