In the past two decades, outsourcing has grown, as a business discipline, across sectors and geographies. For many, their first introduction to outsourcing had its roots in ICT with American companies hiring call center operators in India and elsewhere thus ensuring that business was always open thanks to cost efficient labour in the Global South and differences in time zone.  So, what exactly is outsourcing? It means the transfer of work responsibilities and decision rights to an entity outside the business. While outsourcing can produce significant economic benefits when done right, it is still not recommended for all business.
