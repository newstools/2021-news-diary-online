We note especially with utter perplexity and concern the unrelenting persecution, intimidation, harassment and embarrassment schemed by certain powerful interests in the Presidency against the former EFCC chairman that involves breaches of laid down administrative processes on discipline, disregard for rule of law and brutal encroachment on his fundamental right to integrity and personal liberty.As the representatives of the vast majority of youths from Northern Nigeria, JOINT NORTHERN ACTION FRONT is worried that the targeting of Ibrahim Magu and singling him for such prolonged irreverent treatment is part of symptoms of the disquiet in the country that has been exacerbated by political opportunism and corruption that are now fighting back the system.Conclusively, therefore, the aims of these forces of reaction some of whom are entrenched deeply in the presidency are to subvert and finally halt the war against corruption and reverse the populist tendencies of this government to check the hardships that have been building up since the early part of the previous administration resulting from the massive looting of the treasury and downright theft of the national resources.CULMINATION OF EVENTSThe conspiracy began with the Senate when Magu, who served as acting chairman of the EFCC from 2015 to 2020, was rejected twice by the Upper Chamber of the National Assembly.Magu was later suspended without resort to due administrative procedures for allegedly mismanaging funds of the Commission, an allegation which he vehemently denied and is yet to be proved through the due processes of law. On Monday July 6, 2020, Magu was then accosted and arrested in a Gestapo-like manner reminiscent of the DSS’ raid on the National Assembly in 2018, when his convoy was waylaid by armed security agents.He was later made to go through a probe for over three months by a judicial panel of inquiry led by a former President of the Court of Appeal (PCA), Justice Ayo Salami over alleged mismanagement of recovered assets, corruption, abuse of office and insubordination levelled against him by the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr Abubakar Malami (SAN). Suspiciously, the Salami-led panel made several recommendations in a report submitted to President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday, November 20, 2020.But the Federal Government White Paper on the on the outcome of Salami report has not been made public till date (about nine months after the presentation of the report to Buhari. The peak of it came on Thursday, July 8, 2021, when the Police Service Commission (PSC) approved the promotion of 24 Commissioners of Police (CPs) to the next rank of Assistant Inspectors General of Police (AIGs) but declined the promotion Magu on the pretext of waiting for clearance from the office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice and the Office of the Inspector General of Police.It is important to place on record here that Magu and Malami have had repeated disagreements on the anti-corruption war with many Nigerians, including a member of a Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC), the late Prof Femi Odekunle, believing that Magu’s ordeal is part of a power play by Malami and others who are not comfortable with Magu’s uncompromisingstance on war against graft. SPECIFIC DEMANDS JOINT NORTHERN ACTION FRONTHaving watched and studied carefully and with considerable objectivity and maturity these infamous actions perpetrated against Magu specifically and against the the government’s concerted efforts to check corruption, and against Nigerians collectively, to the point of condoning several unreasonable and unacceptable breeches, hereby resolves that silence is no longer golden and makes the following key demands: SIGNEDComrade Aminu Adamu MusaNational CoordinatorJoint Northern Action Front.
