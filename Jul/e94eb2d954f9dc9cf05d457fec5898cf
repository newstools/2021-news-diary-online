The Students of Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology, Okitipupa, Ondo State, on Friday protested over planned strike by the institution’s Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) .  Damilola Okunomo, President, Students Union Government (SUG),  told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Okitipupa that the ASUU strike would cripple academic activities in the school.  According to Okunomo, the strike will cripple the forthcoming second semester examination scheduled for Aug. 2, 2021. “We have decided to continue the protest until the management and ASUU resolve their grievances, we have paid our school fees and we cannot be denied our examination,” he said.  Meanwhile, in a communiqué signed by Dr Dipo Akomolafe, ASUU Chairman, and its Secretary, Dr Rotini Olorunisola, the union resolved after its congress to commence total and indefinite strike from Aug. 2.  The communiqué said that the union took the decision after several meetings with the institution’s management and governing council failed. It said that both parties could not resolve the issues of non-payment of salaries, reduction in subvention and other issues.  “We want payment of all outstanding salaries and outstanding deductions to date and release of N15 million as part payment of already approved Earned Academic Allowance (EAA).  “The institution should put in place necessary measures to mainstream EAA into salaries, immediate consideration and appropriate approval of the financial implications of the newly prepared EAA already submitted to the management.  “The industrial action will not be suspended until all subsisting issues between the university administration and union are fully addressed,” the communiqué stated.  Meanwhile, efforts by NAN to speak with Mr Ganiyu Saliu, the institutions Registrar over the matter failed as calls to his mobile phone were not going through. (NAN)
