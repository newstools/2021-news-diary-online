Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo has advised residents of the state to observe COVID-19 protocols, as they celebrate the yuletide. This is contained in a Christmas message to the people of the state issued on Friday by the state Chairman of the party, Dr Tony Aziegbemi. He said that the call had become necessary in view of the Omicron variant currently ravaging the country.   “As you celebrate this festive season, remember to observe COVID-19 protocols, especially with the threat of Omicron variant in the air. “Always wear your face masks, maintain social distancing and regularly wash your hands with soap and running water,” the party chairman advised. He expressed PDP’s warm and sincere compliments of the season to ‘the glorious and beautiful people’ of the state.   “As we celebrate this wonderful season, occasioned by the birthday of our Lord Jesus Christ, we give God all the glory for the joy, the victory and strength with which we embraced and endured all the events and revelations that shaped our 2021. “We thank the glorious Edo people for the support and encouragement our government, governor and party have continued to receive. We are grateful.   “May our New Year be filled with special moments of warmth, peace, happiness and successes. “We also wish to express our gratitude to our members for their commitment, love, courage and steadfastness this past year. A year filled with challenges, we are grateful for your support,” he said. Aziegbemi, who described politics as the art of the possible, urged politicians to be guided, as 2022 approached.   “We must continue to show Edo people why they must keep faith with PDP by propagating its programmes and letting them know that only PDP can rescue Nigeria,” he said.
