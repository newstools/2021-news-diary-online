The joint stakeholders forum of the Kano state chapter of the All Progressives Congress(APC)has lodged a complaint to the Inspector General of Police for what the group tagged, “criminal acts of intimidation ,arson and attempt to commit murder “ The letter dated December 2nd,2021 and made available to newsmen yesterday ,was jointly signed bythe six members of the forum led by former Governor, Senator Ibrahim Shekarau and Barau I.Jibrin and four other members who are currently in the House of Representatives. The complainants revealed that since the November 30th verdict of an FCT Abuja court voided the state APC congreses, losers had taken to “criminal acts of intimidation, arson,attempt to commit murder, threats to life and breach of peace “ The complainants listed government officials they considered as masterminds of the destruction,by fire of the campaign office of Senator Barau I. Jibrin(Kano-North.) and those who attempted to cause bodily harm to “those they met in the office”. They said these elements led the mob that also vainly tried to set ablaze “our party office on Zaria road”. “The mob also walked by our residences chanting provocative slogan and threatened those who didn’t share views”. The forum therefore,urged the IGP to investigate thoroughly what caused the mob action resulting in arson with the view to bring culprits to book and also nip in the bud threats to peace and order in the State. They expressed concern that (a prominent figure named in the letter) is known for violent language and disposition and should be watched closely lest he leads mob to cause the breakdown of law and order. Members of the forum assured the police chief that their supporters would not be baited into a confrontation as they are law abiding citizens, they concluded .
