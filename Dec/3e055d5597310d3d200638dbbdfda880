The leadership of the All Progressive Youth Forum (APYF) in Lagos, has declared support for the candidature of Mr Segun Dada as the National Youth Leader of the All Progressive Congress (APC) at the party’s forthcoming National Convention, slated for February 2022. Mr Oguntoyinbo Olanrewaju, State Secretary, Lagos APYF, said in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja that Dada is a committed foot soldier and a thorough progressive.  According to him, Dada had always fought, struggled, argued and projected the APC to success in all ramifications. “He is a thorough progressive who at no time has deviated from the All Progressive mantra, irrespective of interest as far as the flag of the APC is attached.  “Comrade Segun Dada is the pioneer chairman of APC Youth Wing; All Progressive Youth Forum (APYF) in Lagos State between 2012 -2016,” he said. He said declaring support for him has become necessary, especially as President Muhammadu Buhari had approved February 2022 for the conduct of the APC National Convention to elect new National Working Committee (NWC) members for the party.  He called on Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, the state chairman of the party; Mr Cornelius Ojelabi, and the Governor’s Advisory Council, headed by Alhaji Tajudeen Olusi, to support Dada. He expressed optimism that Dada would represent the state properly if given the opportunity to the delight of progressive youths. (NAN)
