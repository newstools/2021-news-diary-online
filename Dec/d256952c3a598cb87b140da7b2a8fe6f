In a congratulatory message issued by his spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, on Wednesday in Abuja,  Buhari rejoiced with the educationist for removing glass ceilings and paving way for women empowerment.   He congratulated the educationist on her achievements over many years, inspired by vision and hardwork, becoming the first female to earn a Ph.D in Nigeria, 1963, and using her resources to create opportunities for other women, particularly in getting education.
