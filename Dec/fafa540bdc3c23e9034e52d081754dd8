The domestic equities market sustained its bearish trend on Wednesday due to losses recorded by MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN) and 13 others. Specifically, the market capitalisation inched lower by N75 billion or 0.34 per cent to close at N22.050 trillion from N22.125 trillion recorded on Tuesday.   Also, the All-Share Index lost 144.35 points or 0.34 per cent to close at 42,244.22, against 42,388.57 recorded on Tuesday. Consequently, the month-to-date loss increased to 2.3 per cent, while the year-to-date return moderated to 4.9 per cent. The market negative performance was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks — MTNN, Lafarge Africa, Zenith Bank, Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN) and FBN Holdings (FBNH).
