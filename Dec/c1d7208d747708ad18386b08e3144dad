UN Secretary-General António Guterres has urged countries to make recovery for people, planet and prosperity their resolution for 2022. Guterres, in his New Year message, said countries could together make recovery for people and planet their priority. “The world welcomes 2022 with our hopes for the future being tested by deepening poverty and worsening inequality…an unequal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines…climate commitments that fall short, and by ongoing conflict, division, and misinformation,” he said. He added that these were “not just policy tests” but “moral and real life tests”. According to him, these are examinations that all of humanity can pass if we commit to making 2022 a year of recovery for everyone. Guterres detailed how best the recovery should be done on each front. “The pandemic requires a bold plan to vaccinate every person, everywhere,” he said. For an economic rescue, the UN chief said that wealthier countries must support the developing world with “financing, investment and debt relief”. Meanwhile, to heal from mistrust and division, he affirmed that a new emphasis must be placed on science, facts and reason. “At the same time, recovery from conflicts calls for a renewed spirit of dialogue, compromise and reconciliation while restoring our planet takes climate commitments that match the scale and urgency of the crisis,” Guterres said. The UN chief also acknowledged that moments of great difficulty were also moments of great opportunity to come together in solidarity. “This is because they offer the chance to unite behind solutions that could benefit all people and to move forward together, with hope in what our human family can accomplish. “Together, let’s make recovery our resolution for 2022,’’ advised the secretary-general.
