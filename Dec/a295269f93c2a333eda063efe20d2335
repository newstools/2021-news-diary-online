By Idris Ibrahim Nigerian troops have reportedly foiled an attempted kidnap attack and neutralised two bandits in gun battle with the brigands in Kaduna State.  The incident occurred along Birnin Yero-Kosau express road in Igabi Local Government Area (LGA) of the state. A resident identified as Suleiman Abubakar was rescued by operation executed by troops from Jura military base, few kilometres away from the flash point.  This was made known Wednesday in a statement issued by Samuel Aruwan, Commissioner, Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs.  According to the statement, the gun-wielding men barricaded the road from Birnin Yero to Kosau, where they kidnapped their victim. “An alarm was raised and troops from the Jura military base swiftly mobilized to the location and pursued the retreating bandits. A gun duel followed, and the troops prevailed, neutralizing two of the bandits and rescuing the abducted person,” Mr Aruwan said.  The statement noted that “Governor Nasir El-Rufai expressed his elation at the report, and commended the troops for their swift response, pursuit of the bandits and the successful rescue. He encouraged them to keep up the good work towards denying bandits freedom of action altogether.”  “The Governor conveyed his best wishes to the rescued hostage, who has since been reunited with his family. Security agencies will sustain monitoring and patrols in the general area,” the statement revealed. In the last 8days, bandits have continued to launch deadly attack along Kaduna-Zaria highway that has led to the deaths and abduction of many residents.  Last week Monday, the marauding gunmen abducted over 30 commuters along Kaduna-Zaria express way as the daredevil gunmen killed a member of the Kaduna State House of Assembly.
