The Presidency has disowned claims by a faction of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Kano State that President Muhammadu Buhari has endorsed it.  A statement signed by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media & Publicity) categorically described the endorsement claims as “untrue.”  The statement reminded the party faithful that the Kano matter is still before the courts.  Newsdiaryonline reports that former Governor Ibrahim Shekarau’s supporters and the incumbent Governor Umar Ganduje’s men are locked in a battle for control of APC in Kano.A Court earlier ruled in favour of the Shekarau faction, but the struggle has remained unabated.  Reacting to claims of endorsement, Shehu said Saturday, “The Presidency wishes to counter a public statement by one of the factions of the All Progressives Congress in Kano State, that they have received the endorsement of President Muhammadu Buhari.  “This is blatantly untrue. This cannot happen when matters are awaiting adjudication by the courts.  “To be clear on this one, President Buhari has not endorsed any faction.  “His support is for the All Progressives Congress as a Party, united and strong, and not of any faction”, Buhari’s aide said.
