The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited has announced a huge leap in trading surplus of ₦141.96billion recorded in June 2021 compared to a deficit of ₦37.46Billion in May 2021.  This is contained in the June 2021 figures of the NNPC Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR). A trading surplus or trading deficit is derived after deduction of the expenditure profile from the revenue for the period under review.  In June 2021, NNPC Group operating revenue as compared to May 2021, decreased by 9.07% or N89.27billion to stand at N894.64billion. Similarly, expenditure for the month decreased by 29.32% or N299.44billion to stand at N721.93billion. Thus, in the period under review, expenditure as a proportion of revenue was 0.81%, compared to the figure in May which stood at 1.04%.  The report also noted that the increase in trading surplus was due mainly to the increased sales of crude oil and gas by the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), an Upstream subsidiary of the NNPC, and the increased gas sales and depreciation postings by the Nigerian Gas Company (NGC).  The positive outlook was further bolstered by the performance of Duke Oil and the Nigerian Gas Marketing Company (NGMC) which also added to the improved bottom line.
