Sen. Umaru Al-Makura (APC – Nasarawa South) has  urged Nigerians to invest in grassroots sports. Al-makura gave the advice while briefing newsmen on Sunday in Lafia at the finals of the Tanko Al-Makura (TAAL) Unity Cup football  competition. The former Nasarawa governor said that sport was a veritable tool capable of engaging the youth and bringing unity.   The Senator said there were lots of raw and untapped talents hidden in the grassroots that just needed platforms to excel. He added that so many youths, who were discovered in the past had made the country proud in different sports.  Al-Makura said that it was out of his desire to provide platforms to the youth to showcase their skills that the competition was organised. He noted that the tournament was very important as it was one of the platforms to consolidate peaceful coexistence in the zone and the state.   “Through this competition, I believe we can discover talents who can make a living through football, represent the country and make us proud as well as be a source of hope to the younger generation. “I appreciate the response that the competition has attracted right from the grassroots and the level of interest and participation,” he added.   He  said that machinery was put in place from the beginning of the competition to take record of the performances of every player for any necessary support to excel. The Senator, therefore, donated N1 million to Water Corporation Football Club of Lafia which emerged winners and N500,000 to Lafia Stars Football Club, the runners up.   In the final of Sen. Umaru Al-Makura Unity Football Competition, Water Corporation FC defeated Lafia Stars 6 – 5 during penalty shootout after goalless full time. (NAN)
