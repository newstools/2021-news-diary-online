The Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel Development in collaboration with Oyo State Government plan to conduct airborne geophysical survey of mineral resources in the state. Mr Kaka Imam, Director of Geophysics Department, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency (NGSA) announced the plan in Ibadan on behalf of Mr Olamilekan Adegbite, Minister of Mines and Steel Development.   He urged residents not to panic or become apprehensive when they hear loud noise emitted by the survey aircraft which would fly at low altitude and in abnormal movement. Imam explained that the public awareness became necessary to forestall misinformation that might cause undue tension in some communities, particularly in the face of current insecurity across the country.   He said it was necessary to penetrate Oyo State and gather geological information that might lead to mineral discoveries there in spite of its difficult terrain. Imam said the exercise would be carried out in Akinyele, Lagelu, Egbeda, Ona- Ara, Ogbomosho North, Ogbomosho South, Ogo Oluwa, Surulere and Orire local government areas, among others. He explained that the exercise would entail the use of latest survey sensors to generate magnetic and radiometric data that would help in potential areas and zones of mineralisation.   Imam explained also that a passive technique would be used in the process that would not involve sending out signals into the ground and therefore remained a very safe aerial survey. Also, Hon. Dimeji Ladapo, the Director-General, Oyo State Mineral Development Agency, assured residents that the exercise would pose no hazard to residents.   Ladapo stressed that the effort would in the long run expand the state’s economy and boost its internally-generated revenue. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that exercise would also hold in 18 other states of the federation for one year, beginning from December. (NAN)
