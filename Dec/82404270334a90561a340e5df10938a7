Trading on the Nigerian stock market resumed the week with positive sentiments following renewed interest in MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN). The  market capitalisation inched higher by N277 billion to close at N22.131 trillion from N21.854 trillion posted on Friday. Also, the All-Share Index grew by 528.15 points or 1.26 per cent to close at 42,411.12 compared with 41,882.97 achieved on Friday.   Accordingly, the month-to-date loss moderated to 1.9 per cent, while year-to-date gain increased to 5.3 per cent. The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; MTNN, Dangote Cement, Vitafoam, GlaxoSmithKline and Nigerian Exchange Group (NGXGroup). This week, analysts at Cordros Securities Ltd expect the bulls to regain dominance in the market given the moderation in the prices of bellwether stocks in the last three weeks.   “However, we do not rule out the possibility of continued profit-taking activities. “In addition, we believe the outcome of the bond auction scheduled to hold during the week will also shape market sentiments. “Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” they said.
