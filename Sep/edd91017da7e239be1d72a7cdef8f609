At least 15 All Progressives Congress (APC) stalwarts in Gombe state have defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) alongside their supporters. Speaking to thousands of PDP supporters on Saturday in Gombe, John Yoriyo, former Deputy Governor  who defected to PDP, said he was not impressed with the happenings in the APC. “It is obvious that the APC has failed in Nigeria, especially in the area of security,” he said.   The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that Yoriyo was a deputy governor under former governor Danjuma Goje, now a senator representing Gombe central. He said the PDP remains the best political party ever, when compared to what is obtainable in the APC.  He said, “I was in the APC and I have seen everything that is happening, nothing encouraging. PDP is the best place to be. “There was nothing like democracy under APC in Gombe. No body knows what is happening, we were ignorant, we are just being ruled,” he explained.  Maj.-Gen. Abnor Kwaskebe (Retired), Chairman PDP, said 15 of the party stalwarts who defected to APC prior to the 2015 elections, have returned home. “We are glad to receive those that left the party, thinking that the PDP had collapsed. They are now coming back home.” (NAN)
