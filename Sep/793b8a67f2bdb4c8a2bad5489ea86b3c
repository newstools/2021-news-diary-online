An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday ordered that a 41-year-old trader, Oladeji Ojo, be remanded for allegedly defiling an 11-year-old girl.  The police charged Ojo, who resides in Ajasa Command of Agbado Oke-Odo, Lagos State, with defilement. Magistrate A.O Layinka, who did not take the plea of Ojo, ordered that he should be remanded in Kirikri Correctional Centre.
