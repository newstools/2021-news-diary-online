An Ekiti Customary court sitting in Ikole-Ekiti on Tuesday dissolved a 15-year-old marriage between Mr Abiodun Omotoyinbo and his wife, Taiwo on grounds of adultery. Delivering Judgment, the President of the Court, Mrs Yemisi Ojo held that the marriage had broken down irretrievably and consequently dissolved the unionOjo ordered both parties to go their separate ways as they stand unmarried. The court president ordered that the nine-year- old child of the union should remain with Omotoyinbo.She ordered the father to be responsible for the payment of the child’s school fees.Ojo ordered Omotoyinbo to allow the child see his mother. Earlier,  the petitioner, Omotoyinbo, 36, a farmer in his evidence, told the court that the respondent was the mother of his child.Omotoyinbo prayed for dissolution because he said he has caught her on several occasions committing adultery and she never showed any remorse.”She threatened my life with fetish substances and has also threatened the life of the woman who is pregnant for me.” Her threat came true because my woman is yet to give birth one year after  she took in,” he said.In her defence, Taiwo, 25, a businesswoman denied all the allegations levelled against her by the petitioner.”I never threatened the petitioner nor the woman who is pregnant for him. I do not agree agree with the dissolution because of my nine-year-old baby,” she said.(NAN)
