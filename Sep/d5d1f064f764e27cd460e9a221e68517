The Federal Government says the approved design for the Dawachiki, Kano Train Station will be a mega station similar to the Ebute-Metta train station in Lagos. Minister of  Transportation,  Mr Rotimi Amaechi, made this known  in a statement,  signed by the Director of Press and Public Relations of the ministry,  Mr Eric Ojiekwe on Saturday.  Amaechi,  when he visited the  Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado-Bayero, at his Palace, said the resolve to replicate the station, was because of the commercial nature of the city and its link to  corridors of transit. The minister further stated that it was pertinent to visit and thank the Emir for his hospitality, in the 5-days of the National Council of Transportation engagement  in the city.  Responding,  the Emir commended Amaechi’s efforts in the transportation sector to reposition the country and urged the minister to do more to better the country. Earlier, the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Dr Magdalene Ajani visited the station to ascertain if the trains were running.  Ajani  said there were  shuttles from Kano to Kaduna and Nguru,  twice a week while that of Kano to Lagos,  which was about 24 hours on the narrow gauge, was  only once a week. The permanent secretary informed that Kano was the most fortunate of all the states,  as it would  benefit from the Standard  Gauge as well as the international one that would run from Kano to Maradi in Niger Republic.  According to her, work has already started at the back ends of the projects.(NAN)
