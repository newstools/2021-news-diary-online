GMD #NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari has joined the Governor of Borno State, Prof. Babagana Umara Zulum to perform the Groundbreaking Ceremony of the Maiduguri & Environs Emergency Power Project (MEPP).  The ceremony will officially mark the commencement of the construction of a 50-megawatt gas turbine power plant expected to generate electricity to the city of Maiduguri, Borno State, and environs. The MEPP is a Federal Government intervention strategy in tackling the perpetual power outage in Maiduguri, caused mostly as a result of incessant vandalism of critical power infrastructure by insurgents.
