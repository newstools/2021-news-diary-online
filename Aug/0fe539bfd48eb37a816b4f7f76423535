Speaking after the announcement, Mr Aruna Ogunsola,  APC Ward Collation  agent, commended LASIEC for a job well done. “There is no winner and there is no vanquished. It was a peaceful election.   “What was declared  was  what we have from our polling agents from  the 43 polling units. Both PDP and APC ward agents signed the results and there is no reason to fight,” he said.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the runoff, followed  the inconclusiveness of the previous poll on  July 24, as a result of a tie between the candidates of APC and PDP. (NAN)
