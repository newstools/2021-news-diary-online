The President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, has commiserated with the family of Alhaji Ahmed Joda, a foremost Nigerian administrator who died on Aug 13, at the age of 91. Lawan, in a statement by Mr Ola Awoniyi, his Special Adviser on Media, in Abuja, on Saturday condoled with the Government and entire people of Adamawa State over the demise of  ‘a great indigene of the state and accomplished citizen of Nigeria’.   “Alhaji  Joda was an administrator par excellence, who, all through his long and fulfilled life, served our dear country, Nigeria with distinction. “His contributions to public administration will remain indelible in the history of the Nigerian public service and bureaucracy.   “One of the last remarkable services of Alhaji Joda was his contribution to the take-off, in 2015, of the President Muhammadu Buhari- led All Progressives Congress (APC) administration, as the Chairman of the Transition Committee that ushered in the administration. “While we will miss his wealth of experience, we can never forget his meritorious service to our dear country,” Lawan said.   He prayed that Allah accepts his soul into Aljannat Fidaus and grant his family the fortitude to bear the immense loss. (NAN)
